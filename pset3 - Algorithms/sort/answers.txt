sort1 uses: Bubble Sort
How do you know?:
The timings show that the program is very fast for already sorted lists, but significantly slower for inverted lists, which is typical of Bubble Sort.

sort2 uses: Selection Sort
How do you know?:
The times were consistent for all input types, indicating that the algorithm traverses the list completely to find the smallest element in each iteration.

sort3 uses: Merge Sort
How do you know?:
The times were fast and consistent for all inputs, which is characteristic of Merge Sort, due to its O(n log n) efficiency.
